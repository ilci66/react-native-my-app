* The last project was from a tutorial I found online and apparently it's a bit dated now, so in this on I will be following the react native website's examples
* Decided to turn this into an app where I can view my own drawings, gotta do more reading
* Wanna use Postgresql for this project with graphql, I don't have any experience with postgresql yet
## Gonna be changing the backend a bit
* now to leanr about getting info from the basic api I just created
* Turns out I'm getting te error because of the certificate. Using the ip adress instead of the localhost to as a fix
* Have been learning basics of PostgreSQL for the last couple of days, now gonna change this project a little
* now i understand postgresql and i'm able to make database calls from my backend, but apparently there are safer and less expensive ways to do queries on apis, gonna learn those now
## Now I have a an idea about the workings of node with PostgreSQL
* Next step will be getting rid of the dummy data and updating the database with my drawings
* Dropping the idea of including sequalize in my backend instead of pg, gonna implement graphql now
* Took lots of notes on sql and graphql...
* Started the raphql part of the backend finally
* I need to figure out what i wanna be able to do with the app, for now i now i wanna be able to see all my drawings and the objects in those drawings as tags, i wanna be able to filter the drawings by the objects,
* I don't yet know what i wanna do by getting individual objects but we will see 
## Cancelled the routes in order to use graphql for now
* Getting couple of errors, gonna fix 'em later
