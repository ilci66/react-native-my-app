## Gonna be changing the backend a bit
* now to leanr about getting info from the basic api I just created
* Turns out I'm getting te error because of the certificate. Using the ip adress instead of the localhost to as a fix
* Have been learning basics of PostgreSQL for the last couple of days, now gonna change this project a little
