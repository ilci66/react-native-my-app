Building JavaScript bundle: error
ERROR
While trying to resolve module `@apollo/client` from file `C:\Users\Irene\Desktop\dev-stuff\my-projects\react-native-apollo-example\guide-react-native\App.js`, the package `C:\Users\Irene\Desktop\dev-stuff\my-projects\react-native-apollo-example\guide-react-native\node_modules\@apollo\client\package.json` was successfully found. However, this package itself specifies a `main` module field that could not be resolved (`C:\Users\Irene\Desktop\dev-stuff\my-projects\react-native-apollo-example\guide-react-native\node_modules\@apollo\client\main.cjs`. Indeed, none of these files exist:

# Tried all the suggestions even cloned the example app given by the apollo docs, still getting the same error
* I will still come to this one to try and fix this but moving on to a new app where i will be creating retty much the same thing but without graphql
