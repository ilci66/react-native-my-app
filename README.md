* The last project was from a tutorial I found online and apparently it's a bit dated now, so in this on I will be following the react native website's examples
* Decided to turn this into an app where I can view my own drawings, gotta do more reading
* Wanna use Postgresql for this project with graphql, I don't have any experience with postgresql yet
## Gonna be changing the backend a bit
* Spent majority of my time learning about PostgreSQL today
* now to leanr about getting info from the basic api I just created
* Turns out I'm getting te error because of the certificate, so apparently there is a software called mkcert which allows me to create a certificate for myself
* I don't wanna look for a way to bypass the error for this project because I might wanna use the same api for other projects with postgreSQL
